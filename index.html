                    My name is Robin and I’m in the slow process of developing my green thumb.
                    In the past, I have been known as somewhat of plant assassin, but not able 
                    to let a challenge go, I’m determined to have a house filled with luscious 
                    green plants. Every month I buy a new plant for me and my girlfriend Charlotte
                    to take care of, but often the collection shrinks as quickly as it grows.
                    I aim for our house to be the perfect lesbian stereotype, filled with cats and 
                    plants. I feel we are halfway there with 2 cats and 20 plants, but there's always
                    room for more.

                    This website provides an A-Z list of some of the house plants that I desire to 
                    own or already take care of. I will outline basic, easy to understand, care tips
                    for: watering, sunlight preferences, required humidity, heat tolerance, 
                    the best potting soil to use and fertilization frequency. Hopefully the information 
                    I have collated will help somebody else to grow their green thumb alongside me, but
                    in the meantime, this will be a great opportunity to develop some website building skills
                    aswell as providing tips and tricks for avid plant collectors.
